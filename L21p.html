            <p id="fruitspara" class="para">
                Initially, blockchain is only used as a foundation of cryptocurrency, but today, we can see the rise of this new
                emerging technology are being implemented in many industries. In the future, most technologies around the world
                are expected to use blockchain as an efficient way to make online transactions. One of the areas that blockchain
                technologies can be applied crowdfunding platforms. The most common problem with the current crowdfunding
                scene around the world is that the campaigns are not regulated and some of the crowd-funding campaigns turned
                out to be fraud. Besides, the completion of some projects was also significantly delayed. This project aims to
                solve these problems by applying Ethereum smart contracts to the crowdfunding site to that the contracts will be
                fully automatically executed, thus preventing frauds and ensuring that the projects can be delivered within
                duration given.

        ventures, including educational projects like the University's new computer lab. However, traditional
        crowdfunding platforms may encounter challenges concerning transparency, accountability, and trust. To overcome
        these obstacles and revolutionize the fundraising process, the University is proud to introduce a cutting-edge
        solution - its own decentralized crowdfunding platform, powered by blockchain technology. <br>
        The University's new crowdfunding platform is designed to offer a secure, efficient, and decentralized ecosystem
        for raising funds to set up a state-of-the- art computer lab. Embracing the potential of blockchain technology,
        this platform aims to transform the way contributions are gathered and managed. By leveraging blockchain's
        transparency and immutability, the University seeks to enhance trust and accountability among donors, ensuring

            <p id="stationorypara" class="para">
                    How does Blockchain support Crowdfunding? <br>
                    There are several areas where block-chain supports and improves crowdfunding, crowdfunding platforms powered by blockchain technology removes the need for intermediate third party.
                    <ul type="square">
                        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Since block-chain is decentralized it doesnâ€™t rely on any other platforms
                            to create funds. for starters, no longer to be obliged to any rules and any project can get visibility and
                            funded if the investors think to invest, eliminates fees which makes crowdfunding less expensive for the
                            creators.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Access Equity:</strong>To provide investors equity or ownership block-chain relies on asset
                            tokenization. For example, a person who plans to create multiple new products with the incoming funds and
                            grant small ownerships stake in the company. This could potentially open a whole new world of opportunity.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Flexible Options: </strong>Using block-chain as asset tokenization grants creators and entrepreneurs
                            more liberties. Usually, asset tokens have their own currency to enable organizations to hire professionals
                            and advertisers.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer: </strong>The cryptocurrencies are exchangeable on a peer-to-peer network. This usually
                            helps the people for their investment which even generates more interest in the entire process.</li>
