    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
    <p>Initially, blockchain is only used as a foundation of cryptocurrency, but today, we can see the rise of this new
        emerging technology are being implemented in many industries. In the future, most technologies around the world
        are expected to use blockchain as an efficient way to make online transactions. One of the areas that blockchain
        technologies can be applied crowdfunding platforms. The most common problem with the current crowdfunding
        scene around the world is that the campaigns are not regulated and some of the crowd-funding campaigns turned
        out to be fraud. Besides, the completion of some projects was also significantly delayed. This project aims to
        solve these problems by applying Ethereum smart contracts to the crowdfunding site to that the contracts will be
        fully automatically executed, thus preventing frauds and ensuring that the projects can be delivered within
        duration given.</p> <br>

    <h2>Project Statement:</h2>
    <p>A University wants to set up a new lab for its students. for this approached to student's parents asking them to
        contribute to gathering funds for setup the new computer lab <br>
        In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, crowdfunding has emerged as a powerful tool for individuals and
        organizations to raise funds for their innovative ideas, charitable causes, and entrepreneurial ventures.
        However, traditional crowdfunding platforms often suffer from issues related to transparency, accountability,
        and trust. <br>To address these challenges, a new crowdfunding platform is being developed that leverages the
        potential of blockchain technology to create a secure, efficient, and decentralized ecosystem for crowdfunding
        campaigns. <br>
        In the fast-paced digital world, crowdfunding has become a potent means for gathering funds to support various
        ventures, including educational projects like the University's new computer lab. However, traditional
        crowdfunding platforms may encounter challenges concerning transparency, accountability, and trust. To overcome
        these obstacles and revolutionize the fundraising process, the University is proud to introduce a cutting-edge
        solution - its own decentralized crowdfunding platform, powered by blockchain technology. <br>
        The University's new crowdfunding platform is designed to offer a secure, efficient, and decentralized ecosystem
        for raising funds to set up a state-of-the- art computer lab. Embracing the potential of blockchain technology,
        this platform aims to transform the way contributions are gathered and managed. By leveraging blockchain's
        transparency and immutability, the University seeks to enhance trust and accountability among donors, ensuring
        that their valuable contributions are utilized effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE:</h2>
    <p>How does Blockchain support Crowdfunding? <br>
        There are several areas where block-chain supports and improves crowdfunding, crowdfunding platforms powered by
        blockchain technology removes the need for intermediate third party.
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Since block-chain is decentralized it doesnâ€™t rely on any other platforms
            to create funds. for starters, no longer to be obliged to any rules and any project can get visibility and
            funded if the investors think to invest, eliminates fees which makes crowdfunding less expensive for the
            creators.</li>
        <li> <strong>Access Equity:</strong>To provide investors equity or ownership block-chain relies on asset
            tokenization. For example, a person who plans to create multiple new products with the incoming funds and
            grant small ownerships stake in the company. This could potentially open a whole new world of opportunity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Universal Opportunity:</strong> Any project using a block-chain-based crowdfunding model can get
            funded. Any person with an internet connection can contribute projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Options: </strong>Using block-chain as asset tokenization grants creators and entrepreneurs
            more liberties. Usually, asset tokens have their own currency to enable organizations to hire professionals
            and advertisers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer: </strong>The cryptocurrencies are exchangeable on a peer-to-peer network. This usually
            helps the people for their investment which even generates more interest in the entire process.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Key Advantages:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Transparency:- </strong>The blockchain-based platform ensures that all transactions and fund 
            utilization are recorded on an immutable ledger. This level of transparency fosters trust 
            among contributors as they can verify how their funds are utilized throughout the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:-</strong> Blockchain's cryptographic features guarantee the secure storage of donors' 
            financial information, reducing the risk of data breaches and fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:- </strong>The crowdfunding platform operates on a decentralized network of 
            nodes, ensuring that no single entity has absolute control. This enhances security and 
            reduces the risk of central point failures.</li>
            
    </ol>
